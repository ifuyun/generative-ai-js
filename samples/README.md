# Google Generative AI Samples for JavaScript

These samples demonstrate how to use state-of-the-art
generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.

To try out these samples, you'll need Node.js v18+.

For some samples of how to adapt this to web, see the `web/` subdirectory.

## Requirements

Follow the instructions on Google AI Studio [setup page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain an API key.

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version control system. Instead, you should use a secrets store for your API key.

This sample assumes that you're providing an `API_KEY` environment variable.

## Instructions

Each of these sample files can be run in Node.js from the command line, for
example:

```
node function_calling.js
```

Some of these files run multiple example cases sequentially, and you may want
to comment out cases you do not want to run.
